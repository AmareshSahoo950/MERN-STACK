# Redux Toolkit Shopping Cart

This project is a simple shopping cart application built with React and Redux Toolkit. It demonstrates how to manage cart state globally using Redux Toolkitâ€™s `createSlice`, including adding items, updating quantities, and removing items from the cart.

## Features

- Add products to the cart
- Increment product quantity if item already exists in cart
- Decrement product quantity or remove item if quantity reaches zero
- View cart items with updated quantities and prices
- Calculate total price dynamically

---

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- React-Redux
- React Router (for navigation)
- Immer (built into Redux Toolkit for immutable updates)
- CSS for styling

## Redux Setup Details

- Used `createSlice` to create a cart slice with reducers:
  - `addToCart` adds an item or increments quantity if item exists
  - `removeFromCart` decrements quantity or removes item if quantity hits zero
- Used `useDispatch()` and `useSelector()` React-Redux hooks to dispatch actions and read state in components

---

## Usage

- Browse products and click **Add to Cart** to add an item or increment its quantity
- Hence all items are added in the cart
- Adjust quantities using **+** and **-** buttons or remove items completely

## Learnings

This project helps understand:

- Global state management with Redux Toolkit
- React Redux hooks for state and dispatch
- Separation of UI components and state logic.
